      <h2>About the Kaleidoscope District</h2>
      <div>
        I'm Jen, the maker of the kaleidoscopes and teleidoscopes. Thank you for
        taking the time to explore my creations! Here is a little bit of
        backstory for the context of my company. 
      </div>
      <div>
        During the early stages of the pandemic I began learning to make
        kaleidoscopes with acrylic mirror and whatever materials I could find
        from previous artistic endeavors. Because I couldn't go back to my
        regular job of massage therapy for many months, I delved into learning
        how to cut glass and solder it together to make more high quality
        scopes. 
      </div>
      <div>
        Now, I am working with first surface mirror, stained glass, lead free
        solder and epoxy clay to create designs that hold up over time and offer
        a unique style of scope for people that are attracted to them. 
      </div>
      <div>
        Like many of us, I experience anxiety and have tried many avenues to
        work with my mind and attention to be able to live the fullest life
        possible and help others along the way. Kaleidoscopes and teleidoscopes
        have a magical way of bringing me right into the present moment that I
        appreciate in times of extreme stress or sadness and I hope to bring
        that gift of an experience to others. 
      </div>

        It can feel almost painfully metaphorical the way a simple teleidoscope
        bends light through a clear marble, and shapes it into patterns that are
        appealing and magical. The same old familiar room or brick wall suddenly
        becomes a work of art for you to appreciate through its lens, and can
        feel like a fresh perspective. 
      </div>
      <div>
        The kaleidoscopes with oil filled chambers and bits of broken glass and
        jewels can also feel metaphorical and inspiring in a different way. The
        way that a bunch of broken pieces can rejoin again and again in
        different patterns can be a reminder to appreciate the different aspects
        of ourselves and each other, and the forever unfolding relationships and
        patterns between the pieces. 
      </div>
      <div>
        I look forward to improving many things about my work. I'm sure many
        people relate to the feeling of things you create never being "good
        enough" especially when you have a naturally self-critical mind.
        However, I have seen the faces of people I love light up when they look
        through these teleidoscopes and kaleidoscopes. I know that they bring
        joy to others and I absolutely love putting them out into the world for
        people to find. I try to be very clear in each etsy description on what
        might be not quite-right with each one- whether it's a mirror angle
        imperfection, or a physical flaw, and I appreciate the positive feedback
        I've received along the way so that I can continue to learn and explore
        and help bring a little bit of magic to more places in the world.

      <div>Take care and be well!</div>
